    "# Lab 1: 'Singularity Machine Learning - Classification' by Multiverse Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on lab exploring the power of the 'Singularity Machine Learning - Classification' function. In this session, you'll walk through a real-world machine learning task—grid stability classification—leveraging both classical and quantum-enhanced techniques. You'll gain experience using a hybrid workflow that seamlessly integrates scikit-learn preprocessing with quantum ensemble classifiers hosted on IBM's serverless infrastructure. Whether running simulations or real quantum hardware, this lab gives you a practical glimpse into how scalable quantum machine learning can accelerate real-world applications. Beyond just building models, the goal of this notebook is to familiarize you with the capabilities of the QuantumEnhancedEnsembleClassifier and help you develop intuition around its features and advantages. You'll begin by establishing a classical benchmark using AdaBoost, then proceed through three exercises that demonstrate key functionalities: running the quantum classifier with a simulated quantum backend, simulating a heterogeneous ensemble with diverse learners, and finally executing the classifier on real quantum hardware. Each step is designed to build your confidence with the tool and deepen your understanding of where and how quantum optimization can offer meaningful benefits. Let’s dive in!"

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `QuantumEnhancedEnsembleClassifier` is a hybrid machine learning model from Multiverse Computing's 'Singularity Machine Learning - Classification' Function, combining classical ensemble methods—like boosting and bagging—with quantum optimization algorithms such as QAOA. Unlike classical ensembles, which become increasingly expensive to train as the number of learners grows, this quantum classifier demonstrates favorable scalability properties: training time remains comparatively stable as the number of learners (and thus qubits) increases. This makes it especially well-suited for problems that require large ensembles—where classical models tend to struggle with optimization costs that scale exponentially. Additionally, unlike traditional quantum models such as QSVMs, which are often constrained by dataset size, this classifier is designed to operate independently of the number of data points and features—limited primarily by available hardware infrastructure—making it well-suited for processing large-scale, high-dimensional datasets. As quantum hardware scales, so too will the accuracy and performance of this model—offering a compelling trajectory for future real-world quantum advantage. In this notebook, we demonstrate its use in both classical simulation and real quantum execution, showcasing its potential and flexibility.\n",

    "## Understanding the Optimization Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively use the `QuantumEnhancedEnsembleClassifier`, it's important to understand the role of several key parameters that influence model training and optimization. Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/multiverse-computing-singularity) for details on the usage and parameters for this function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the key parameters, also used in this lab, are explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`regularization`**  \n",
    "  This parameter controls the complexity of the final ensemble. A higher value penalizes large or complex learner combinations, promoting simpler models and reducing the risk of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`num_solutions`**  \n",
    "  Defines the number of candidate ensemble configurations that the optimizer evaluates. Higher values lead to more exhaustive searches and can uncover better-performing ensembles, but at the cost of increased runtime. For demonstration, values around `100,000` balance exploration and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`simulator`**  \n",
    "  Setting this to `True` enables classical optimization—faster and well-suited for quick experimentation but does not benefit from the scalability advantages of quantum computation. Setting it to `False` activates quantum optimization via QAOA, ideal for larger ensembles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`classical_optimizer_options`**  \n",
    "  These options define the behavior of the underlying classical optimizer used in QAOA. For instance, `{\"maxiter\": 10}` limits the number of optimization iterations—useful for short demos, but convergence usually improves with `60+` iterations in real applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters give you flexibility to balance speed, accuracy, and compute resource use. In the following sections, you'll experiment with both classical and quantum setups to see these trade-offs in action.\n"

    "# Scaling Benefits and Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "The true power of the `QuantumEnhancedEnsembleClassifier` comes into play in scenarios that involve **large ensemble sizes** or **high-dimensional optimization**. While in this lab we limited the number of learners and iterations (`maxiter = 10`) to ensure the job completes in under 30 minutes, it's important to note that quantum optimization algorithms like QAOA typically require 60 or more iterations to converge effectively. This setting provides only a glimpse of the potential performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical ensemble optimization, the training time scales poorly—often exponentially—as the number of learners increases. This makes it impractical for large ensemble configurations due to the combinatorial nature of selecting optimal learners. On the other hand, quantum optimization is expected to scale much more favorably as you increase the number of learners or the problem size (e.g., qubits). In practice, this means quantum methods can remain efficient even when classical methods become infeasible."
