    "The dynamic portfolio optimization problem involves determining the optimal investment strategy over multiple time periods in order to maximize the expected return of the portfolio and minimize risks, often under certain constraints such as transaction costs, or risk aversion. Unlike standard portfolio optimization, which considers a single time to rebalance the portfolio, the dynamic version accounts for the evolving nature of assets and rebalance the investment based on changes in asset performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the dynamic portfolio optimization problem, we formulate it as a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem. In this approach, the variables are discretized based on the number of assets in the portfolio, the number of time steps considered, and the number of resolution bits used to define the investment strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the formulation described in our [manuscript](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19150), the QUBO problem is framed as a multi-objective optimization task, aiming to maximize the expected return, minimize risks, and reduce transaction costs (expenses associated with changing positions over time). Additionally, we introduce a penalty term to enforce the maximum investment per asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final goal is to obtain a binary string as a solution, indicating how much to invest in each asset at each point in time. To illustrate this, consider a simplified case with 3 assets and 3 time steps. \n",
