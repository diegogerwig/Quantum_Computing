    "Welcome to Qiskit Global Summer School. We’re delighted that you are interested in using Q-CTRL’s Fire Opal Performance Management Function. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fire Opal Performance Management](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/q-ctrl-performance-management) makes it simple for anyone to achieve meaningful results from quantum computers at scale without needing to be quantum hardware experts. When running circuits with Fire Opal Performance Management, AI-driven error suppression techniques are automatically applied, enabling the scaling of larger problems with more gates and qubits. This approach reduces the number of shots required to reach the correct answer, with no added overhead — resulting in significant savings in both compute time and cost. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Management suppresses errors and increases the probability of getting the correct answer on noisy hardware. In other words, it increases the signal-to-noise ratio, allowing for faster convergence on the correct result with less shots. By getting the right answer faster, you save significant compute runtime. Learn more [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/q-ctrl-performance-management).\n",

    "# Function description and details\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire Opal Performance Management has two options for execution that are similar to the Qiskit Runtime primitives, so you can easily swap in the Q-CTRL Sampler and Estimator. The general workflow for using the Performance Management function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Define your circuit (and operators in the case of the Estimator).\n",
    "1. Run the circuit.\n",
    "2. Retrieve the results.\n",
    "3. To reduce hardware noise, Fire Opal employs a range of AI-driven error suppression techniques depicted in the following image. With Fire Opal, the entire pipeline is completely automated with zero need for configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire Opal's pipeline eliminates the need for additional overhead, such as increased quantum runtime or extra physical qubits. Note that classical processing time remains a factor (refer to the [Benchmarks](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/q-ctrl-performance-management#benchmarks) section for estimates, where \"Total time\" reflects both classical and quantum processing). In contrast to error mitigation, which requires overhead in the form of sampling, Fire Opal's error suppression works at the gate level to address various sources of noise and to prevent the likelihood of an error occurring. By suppressing errors, the need for expensive post-processing is eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function offers two primitives, Sampler and Estimator, and the inputs and outputs of both extend the implemented spec for [Qiskit Runtime V2 primitives](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/primitive-input-output). For details on Estimator inputs and outputs, refer to details [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/q-ctrl-performance-management#estimator-inputs). For details on Sampler inputs and outputs, refer to details [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/q-ctrl-performance-management#sampler-inputss). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For details on the full Performance Management pipeline, refer to the [published paper](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.20.024034). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For details on benchmarks, refer to details [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/q-ctrl-performance-management#benchmarks). <br>\n",

    "The Estimator has efficient grouping of observables - it tries to minimize the number of circuits sent for execution, by grouping qubit-wise commuting observables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commuting observables are quantum operators (represented here as Pauli strings) that can be measured together because the order in which you apply them doesn’t matter - their measurements don’t interfere with each other. Mathematically, two observables `A` and `B` commute if `AB = BA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Pauli operators \"Z\" and \"I\" commute, so observables like \"ZIII\" and \"IZIZ\" commute with each other. This property allows quantum algorithms to group and measure them efficiently in a single circuit.\n",
