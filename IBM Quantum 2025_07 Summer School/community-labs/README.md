# QGSS-2025-community-labs


As part of the future leaders in quantum hackathon: https://aiforgood.itu.int/the-future-leaders-in-quantum-hackathon/ the winners in the education category got the chance to provide their created educational labs to participants on the Qiskit Global Summer School as community labs. The labs linked here are optional for the Qiskit Global Summer School and provide additional challenges in case you still want to do more and we highly recommend them if you are interested in learning more about the subjects.

We were really happy with what the participants of the FLIQ hackathon created and present here the winners:


1. Quantum Error Correction with the Surface-17 Code by Dev Verma
2. Quantum Simulation of GUT Baryogenesis by Mukul Kumar & Vivek Pal
3. Grover's Algorithm - Quantum Searching with Qiskit by Felix Arkle & Sebastian Gotto
4. CHSH Game: Testing the Limits of Reality with Quantum Mechanics by Lakshmi Yendapalli


# 1. Quantum Error Correction with the Surface-17 Code

## Author Dev Verma

I recently graduated from NTU as a scholar in Applied Physics. I am passionate about quantum computing and cryptography and will be working towards growing my understanding and expertise in these fields. 

## About the Challenge: 

My Jupyter notebook is a tutorial on quantum error correction, focusing on the surface-17 code, which is one of the most promising approaches to quantum error correction. The tutorial assumes no background in error correction; it builds the reader's understanding from simple classical repetition codes to the stabiliser formalism, and ultimately the surface-17 code. It also discusses the heavy-hex lattice architecture, which is more realistic for the current dominant quantum hardware configuration - IBM's superconducting circuits.

# 2. Quantum Simulation of GUT Baryogenesis

## Authors Mukul Kumar & Vivek Pal

Mukul Kumar is an 18-year-old dropout student researching nature simulations on quantum computers and he created this challenge together with Vivek Pal.

## About the Challenge: 

Our challenge is basically a fun experiment that helps you learn about the beginning of the universe and some unsolved mysteries, all of which we are going to study with quantum circuits.

# 3. Grover's Algorithm - Quantum Searching with Qiskit

## Authors Felix Arkle & Sebastian Gotto

Felix Arkle: Currently an undergraduate student at Newcastle University studying computer science. Sebastian Gotto: A recent graduate of UCL having studied Statistics, Economics and Finance.

## About the Challenge: 

This lab focuses on building and demonstrating Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm. You'll construct the necessary quantum circuits, including the oracle and diffusion operators. This lab is suitable for beginners.

# 4. CHSH Game: Testing the Limits of Reality with Quantum Mechanics

## Author Lakshmi Yendapalli

Lakshmi Yendapalli is a former strategy consultant turned computer scientist, currently pursuing her master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. She’s especially fascinated by what mischief qubits are up to when no one’s looking.

## About the Challenge: 

Ever wanted to recreate some of the experiments that earned the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics? How about proving Einstein wrong while we’re at it? In this hands-on lab on the CHSH game, we’ll explore the surprising foundations of quantum mechanics. Starting from the EPR paradox and Einstein-Bohr debates, we’ll journey through the development of Bell's theorem, culminating in the CHSH inequality. Then we’ll jump into Qiskit to build and run quantum circuits that experimentally demonstrate the CHSH inequality.
