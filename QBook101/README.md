# [QWorld](https://qworld.net)'s QBook101


The **QBook101** is a compilation of the tutorials [Bronze](https://gitlab.com/qworld/bronze-qiskit), [Nickel](https://gitlab.com/qworld/nickel), and [Silver](https://gitlab.com/qworld/qeducation/educational-materials/silver-qcourse511), and a little more.

**QBook101** is a collection of Jupyter notebooks, and each notebook has many tasks to provide hands-on experience.

_Chapter 1_ begins by reviewing the mathematics that will be needed throughout the book and a bit of the principles of quantum mechanics. _Chapter 2_ deals with classical probabilistic states and later with quantum states based on real numbers and their visualization on the unit circle. _Chapter 3_ introduces the use of quantum states with complex numbers, the visualization of qubits with the Bloch sphere, and the effect of quantum gates. _Chapter 4_ begins to discuss quantum algorithms, starting with Grover's algorithm and continuing with the algorithms of Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Simon. _Chapter 5_ continues studying more advanced quantum algorithms, going through quantum phase estimation and culminating with Shor's algorithm.
The book includes _four appendices_ covering basic Math, Python, Qiskit, and Cirq topics.

## Prerequisite

The prerequisites are not many, they include familiarity with high school mathematics, a little programming, ideally with Python. If necessary, you can consult the first two appendices that cover these topics and provide tasks for practice; Additionally, a quick review is made in Chapter 1.

## QBook101's sections

- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Classical and Quantum Systems with Real Numbers
- Chapter 3: Quantum Systems with Complex Numbers
- Chapter 4: Quantum Algorithms 1
- Chapter 5: Quantum Algorithms 2

The complete content can be consulted in the [START notebook](./START.ipynb) or on the [QBook101 website](https://qworld.net/qbook101/).

## Access content

You have two options for running notebooks from this **QBook101**:

1. **Online**: Run them in Google Colab, you can start from [this website](https://qworld.net/qbook101/) with the links.
2. **Local**: Install locally what is necessary to run them on your personal computer:

   1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

   2. Get a copy of [QBook101](https://gitlab.com/qworld/qeducation/qbook101)

      - You may clone it on your local computer, or,
      - you may download the source code and then upzip it on your local computer.
      - _If you are a beginner, keep your local copy on your desktop for easy access._

   3. Anaconda -> Jupyter Notebook -> Access the local copy of our repo -> Open the file "START.ipynb"

Details about these two options can be consulted in the [PDF file](How_to_Run_the_Notebooks.pdf)
