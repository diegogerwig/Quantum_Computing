If we have those two numbers, we can easily multiply those  to get that large integer. But factorizing that large integer is difficult. This mathematical problem is the background of most popular public cryptography encryption protocols - RSA and ECC.\n",

    "**Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm** that finds the prime factors of an integer in polynomial time. So, it's possible to break RSA encryption by constructing a large quantum computer. Any reasonably sized RSA key will be broken by a quantum computer of comparable size using Shor's algorithm.\n",
