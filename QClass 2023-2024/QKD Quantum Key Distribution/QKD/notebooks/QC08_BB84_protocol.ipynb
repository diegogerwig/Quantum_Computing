    "> A single-photon pulse is passed through a polarizer. Asja can use a particular polarizer to polarize a single-photon pulse and encode binary value bits to the outcome of a particular type (vertical, horizontal, circular, etc) of a polarizer. On receiving the photon beam, Balvis would guess the polarizer, and he can thus match the cases with Asja and know the correctness of his guesses. If Espian would have been trying to decode, then due to polarization by Espian’s polarizer, there would be discrepancies in match cases of Asja & Balvis and thus they would know about eavesdropping.\n",
    "Examples are BB84, B92, SARG04.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **E91 and variants (Based on Quantum Entanglement)**\n",
    "> There is a single source that emits a pair of entangled photons with Asja & Balvis receiving each particle. Similar to the BB84 scheme, Asja & Balvis would exchange encoded bits and match cases for each photon transferred. But in this scenario, the outcome of the results of the match cases of Asja & Balvis will be the opposite as a consequence of the Entanglement principle. Either of them will have complement bits in bit strings interpreted. One of them can then invert bits to agree upon a key. Since Bell’s Inequality should not hold for entangled particles, thus this test can confirm the absence of eavesdroppers. Since practically it is not possible to have a third photon in entanglement with energy levels sufficient for nondetect ability, thus this system is fully secure. "
