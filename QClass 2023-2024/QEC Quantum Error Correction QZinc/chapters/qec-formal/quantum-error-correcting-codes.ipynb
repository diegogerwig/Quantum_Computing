Whenever, there is enough information extractable from every corrupted codeword so as to reverse the effects of the error. Let's build some basic results that will lead us to some precise mathematical conditions.\n",

    "* First, note that given any error $E_a$ and any state $\\ket{\\psi} \\in \\vecs{C}$ the corrupted codeword $\\ket{\\tilde\\psi} = E_a\\ket{\\psi}$ must be completely outside the code. If it is not, what would happen?

Now, $\\ket{\\psi}$ is in the code, then so is $\\ket{\\psi_c}$ (up to a normalization) and it is some other valid codeword. Hence, the effect of the error $E_a$ on $\\ket{\\psi_c}$ is to keep it inside the code, i.e.\\ map it onto a different codeword. This is clearly a bad situation because Bob would just assume that no error has occurred and $E_a\\ket{\\psi_c}$ is the codeword Alice meant to send. Hence, by contradiction, we infer that our code must be designed so that all errors move every codeword out of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, suppose we have an orthogonal basis $\\set{\\ket{\\psi_i}}_i$ for $\\vecs{C}$. Given any error $E_a$, what do we require of $E_a\\ket{\\psi_i}$ and $E_a\\ket{\\psi_j}$ for $i\\ne j$, so the decoder can function. We will need these two corrupted codewords to remain orthogonal, so that the decoder has enough information to correctly decode. To see this, let's assume to the contrary that the corrupted states are not orthogonal, i.e. $(\\bra{\\psi_i}E_a^\\dagger)( E_a\\ket{\\psi_j}) \\ne 0$. To tease out the non-orthogonal part of this inner product, let's write\n",

As in the argument above, $\\ket{\\psi_\\parallel}$ must also be a valid codeword (because it is part of $\\ket{\\psi_j}$). And because $\\ket{\\psi_i}$ and $\\ket{\\psi_j}$ are perpendicular, $\\ket{\\psi_\\parallel}$ and $\\ket{\\psi_i}$ are distinct codewords. Hence, we discover that two distinct codewords, $\\ket{\\psi_\\parallel}$ and $\\ket{\\psi_i}$, when acted upon by error $E_a$ result in the same corrupted codeword. This is again a bad situation, because the decoder will be unable to decide how to fix the error on the corrupted codeword. Hence, in order to have an error-correcting code that works, we need each error to map orthogonal basis vectors of $C$ to orthgonal states,\n",

In words, if these two corrupted codewords are not orthogonal, then there is a part of $\\ket{\\psi_j}$, called $\\ket{\\psi_\\parallel}$, that under the action of $E_b$ becomes parallel to $E_a\\ket{\\psi_i}$. As above, $\\ket{\\psi_\\parallel}$ is a valid codeword. If the Bob receives $E_a\\ket{\\psi_i} = E_b\\ket{\\psi_\\parallel}$, then his decoder will be unable to tell if Alice sent $\\ket{\\psi_i}$ which was distorted by $E_a$ or $\\ket{\\psi_\\parallel}$ which was distorted by $E_b$.

First of all, let's make it clear that these don't need to be orthogonal - though they can be. We saw the example of the phase-flip code where the action of $Z$ on different qubits yielded the same corrupted codeword.
