    "\n",
    "* This book focuses deeply on methods and algorithms. This is unlike many other introductions which limit themselves to abstract discussions, simple examples, and mathemtical proofs. While theorems and their proofs are an essential part of the book, the author believes that intuition and understanding cannot be built without getting one's hands dirty in algorithmic implementations and mathematical calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Stac](https://github.com/abdullahkhalids/stac) stands for **Sta**bilizer **c**odes, and this library is designed to work with them. Many of the algorithms that I introduce in the book are implemented within this library. It is a very simply library and easy to pick up as you read the book. However, many of the tasks and exercises in the book can be completed in pure python and your favorite quantum SDK."
